# **Requirements Analysis for Local Area Network (LAN)**

## **1. Introduction**
This document outlines the essential requirements for establishing a Local Area Network (LAN). A well-analyzed network ensures efficient operation, security, and user satisfaction.

***In order for us to let us listen to a short story***

**Once upon a time in the bustling town of Techville, there was a friendly network named Netty.** Netty had one simple job: to connect all the people and their devices in the neighborhood, ensuring they could talk to each other, share files, and access the wonderful world of the Internet.

But as more people moved into Techville, Netty had to figure out how to handle the growing crowd! This is the story of how Netty built a reliable, secure, and fast system to keep everyone happy.

## **2. Users**
### **What Are Users?**
Users are the individuals who will access the your network, using various devices such as computers, printers, and servers.

<!--  ### **Example:**
In our office, we have:
- **Employees**: 20 computers
- **Printers**: 3 networked printers
- **Servers**: 2 file servers for data storage 

### **Visual:**
*(Include an infographic showing different types of users and devices in an office setting)* -->
 **Netty's Dilemma**: More people meant more devices! Each household had computers, printers, and even servers (big machines that helped store and share important information).
   - **The Solution**: Netty needed to figure out exactly how many people and devices there were. It was like planning a big neighborhood party—you had to know how many tables, chairs, and plates you needed!

So whenever Designing a network we have to makesure what are traffic you are expecting and design the system Accordingly
like while using Topology which we will learn further in the Documentation

## **3. Security**
### **Importance of Security**
Network security protects data and resources from unauthorized access and attacks.

- **Netty’s Security Worries**: Not everyone in the world was as friendly as Techville’s residents. There were “Data Thieves” who wanted to sneak into the neighborhood and steal information. Netty had to protect the town!

   - **The Solution**: Netty put up a
     - **Firewall** (a high-tech gatekeeper) at every entrance to make sure only authorized people could get in. And even if they got past the gate, 
     - **Encryption** turned all the important messages into secret codes, so only the right people could read them. 
     - **Authentication** Netty used Authentication to make sure everyone was who they said they were(like passwords or even face recognition).

**note** - While designing a network you need to use the following measures to

## **4. Devices**
### **Essential Network Devices:**
- **Routers**: Direct traffic between different networks.
- **Switches**: Connect devices within the same network.
- **Access Points**: Provide wireless connectivity to devices.
- Different types of cables (like Ethernet cables) are used to connect these devices.

***it's story Time !!***

**The Network Heroes**
   - **Netty’s Helpers**: Netty couldn’t handle everything on its own. It had a team of devices to help:
     - **Router Ricky**: He directed traffic, making sure data got to the right place, like a traffic cop.
     - **Switch Sandy**: She managed data between devices in the same house, helping neighbors talk to each other faster.
     - **Access Point Andy**: He boosted the signal in houses far away, making sure everyone could stay connected.
     - **Cabling Casey**: Casey was the roads and highways, making sure every house and device had a pathway to follow.

So these are the components used in a network to communicate to various Devices which will be thought in detail in Hardware and software selection

## **5. IP Allocation**
### **What is an IP Address?**
An IP address is a unique identifier for each device on the network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

### **Static vs. Dynamic IP Allocation:**
- **Static IP**: Fixed address assigned to a device (good for servers).
- **Dynamic IP**: Address assigned temporarily through DHCP (good for most users).

***Excited for another story ?***

 - **Netty’s Smart Solution**: Just like every house had a street address, each device needed an address so Netty could find them. Netty used two kinds of addresses:
     - **Static IP**: Like permanent addresses for important places (like the town hall or the post office).
     - **Dynamic IP**: Temporary addresses for people who visited often but didn’t stay forever, like visitors at a hotel.

- **The Solution**: Netty decided who needed a static address and who could get a temporary one using DHCP (the town’s smart address assigner).
<!-- ### **Visual:**
*(Use a flowchart to illustrate the differences between static and dynamic IP allocation)* -->

## **6. Operating Systems**
### **Importance of Compatibility**
Ensuring that devices running different operating systems can communicate effectively is crucial for a functional network.

### **Common Operating Systems:**
- **Windows**
- **Linux**
- **macOS**

**Speaking Different Languages**
   - **Netty’s Translator Task**: Not everyone in Techville spoke the same language. Some people used **Windows** (the language of the West), some spoke **Linux** (the language of the East), and a few even used **macOS** (from the far-off MacMountain).
   - **The Solution**: Netty became a translator! It used **protocols** to make sure all the devices, no matter what language they spoke, could understand each other and share data smoothly.

## **Conclusion**
Understanding these components is vital for the successful setup and operation of a Local Area Network. This documentation serves as a reference guide for users to familiarize themselves with the basic requirements.

**Wrapping Up: A Happy Network**
   - **Netty’s Victory**: After putting all these elements in place—managing the number of people and devices, ensuring the right amount of bandwidth, adding security, setting up IP addresses, and making sure everyone could speak the same language—Netty created a seamless, fast, and secure system. The whole neighborhood of Techville could browse the internet, share files, and communicate with ease.

   **Illustration Idea**: A final image of Techville, with happy people using their devices, connected through Netty, with all its helpers (routers, switches, firewalls) working together to keep everything running smoothly.

### **The Moral of the Story**:
Networking may seem complex, but when you think of it as a team of friends like Netty, Router Ricky, and Firewall Freddy working together to keep everyone connected and safe, it all starts to make sense. And with the right setup, your own **network** can run just as smoothly as Techville.
